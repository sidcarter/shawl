An interface to schwab.com using Scala and (Gistlabs Mechanize):"http://gistlabs.com/software/mechanize-for-java/"	

# Why?

	I could have used a pre-existing Python module for this, but I decided to learn Scala
	and this came out in the process. There is hardly any documentation for Gistlabs Mechanize for java,
	so I thought I could look through the source and do what I do best.
